  - try Github Copilot code review is now generally available, agent not only finds bugs, but also suggests fixes, available to all paid Copilot subscribers (request review before commit or review new pull request) #try

  - try Claude 3.7 Sonnet is the best performer for vibe coding, GPTs are the worst, Prompts that generally specified a need for security produced more secure results, while those that asked for code that complied with Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) best practices performed better #try

  - Microsoft Entra - each new agent gets identity and admins assign them permissions and monitor data access etc, .. Prompt Shields guardrail - prompt injections
- Flowise - visual agentic orchestration - agentic no-code workflows (including web scrapper tool, extended memory, human interaction tools,..)
- toxic agent flows - vulnerability of Github MCP server - prompt injection in public repo issue caused leakage of data from private repo from the same author https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-github-vulnerability

- 20250613 - LLM agents are not yet great at coordinating and delegating to other agents in real time, we’ve found that multi-agent systems excel at valuable tasks that involve heavy parallelization, information that exceeds single context windows, and interfacing with numerous complex tools
	-> research system - orchestrator - worker pattern, where a lead agent coordinates the process while delegating to specialized subagents that operate in parallel
	-> important to limit number of calls of tools for subagents and to create distinct subtasks
	-> let agents improve themselves (i.e. rewrite description of flawed MCP server)
	-> automated LLM evaluations plus manual human testing
	-> opensource prompts for leader and subagents https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents/prompts
	-> without effective mitigations, minor system failures can be catastrophic for agents. When errors occur, we can't just restart from the beginning: restarts are expensive and frustrating for users -> combine the adaptability of AI agents with deterministic safeguards like retry logic and regular checkpoints
	-> agents are non-deterministic between runs, even with identical prompts, this makes debugging harder
	-> [rainbow deployments](https://brandon.dimcheff.com/2018/02/rainbow-deploys-with-kubernetes/) to avoid disrupting running agents, by gradually shifting traffic from old to new versions while keeping both running simultaneously
	-> our lead agents execute subagents synchronously, waiting for each set of subagents to complete before proceeding
